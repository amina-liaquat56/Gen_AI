# Synthetic Skin Lesion Generator using DCGAN

This project uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic dermoscopic images of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). 
The goal is to create synthetic images that help in data augmentation for training deep learning classifiers.

## Project Goals
- Generate synthetic dermoscopic BCC images.
- Improve dataset diversity for skin cancer detection tasks.
- Evaluate generated images using visual inspection and FID scores.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- DCGAN Architecture
- ISIC 2019 Dataset (BCC images)



##  Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib`
3. Run the notebook to train the DCGAN on your dataset.

## Dataset
Download BCC images from the [ISIC Archive](https://www.isic-archive.com).
